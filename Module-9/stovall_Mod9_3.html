       <p> Movie Dialog
       <p> “I watched my father burn to death. I can still remember him <span id = "screaming">_________</span>. The people who were there said my father died long before 	the tanks blew. They said it was me that was screaming.”
       <p> “Maybe you’re lying to yourself. Maybe you’re not the good guy <span id = "pretending">_________</span> to be the bad guy. Maybe you’re the bad guy pretending to 	    be the good guy. Did you ever think about that?”
       <p> “You’re Loyal To A Fault. Your Code Is About Family And That’s Great In The Holidays, But It Makes You Predictable. And In Our Line Of Work, Predictable Means 	    <span id = "vulnerable">_________</span>. And That Means I Can Reach Out And Break You Whenever I Want.” 
       <p> “Every day for the last three weeks you’ve been coming in here and you’ve been asking me how the tuna is. Now, it was <span id = "crappy">_________</span> 	    	    yesterday, it was crappy the day before and guess what? It hasn’t changed.”
