        <p class="intro">
            Hello everyone my name is Brett, I am currently learning how to be a computer IT tech. I am a mortgage banker at the current time and thought I would go back to s
		school and finish my degree in something I enjoy doing. I was in he military for 13 years before i was dis charged due to an injury.
        </p>

        <p>
            I come from a small city town in Missouri, and have traveled all acrossed the world before I setteled down in my lake house. The town oi grow up in there was not 		much to do unless you liked to party or go to a fair once a year and there was not that many jobs there to work thats why i join the military.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am married to the perfect girl in the world so has done so much for me. We have 4 children and a granddaughter that we love to watch every day. My kids are all 		grow up and have done so much with their lives and I can ask for a better life then I have now. 
        </p>

        <p>
           My hobbies are fishing and working on cars, I have recently jut boat a boat and have been learning about everything I can do to make it better. My wife also loves 	to go fishing with me too and we would spend 14 or more hours just sitting there and talking. I also love to work on my house when I get a change to.  </span>
